<h1>DLF</h1>
Delhi Land & Finance (DLF Limited) is a commercial real estate developer. It was 
founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946 and it is based in New Delhi, India.
DLF developed residential colonies in Delhi such as, Model Town,Rajouri Garden,
Krishna Nagar,South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. 
DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.With the passage of Delhi 
Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate 
developmentin Delhi and banned private real estate developers.As a result, DLF 
began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the 
Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, in the adjacent state of 
Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at 
Gurgaon.Its plans included hotels, infrastructure and special economic zones-related 
development projects.

<h1>BARBEQUE NATION</h1>
<body>
Barbeque Nation was founded in 2006 with a simple vision – offering a complete dining
experience to customers at affordable prices.One of the most successful casual dining 
chains in India, Barbeque Nation pioneered the concept of live grills embedded under 
dining tables – allowing customers to grill their own barbecue’s right at their 
tables.A novelty at the time, the restaurant allowed clients to customize their own
starters with their preference of flavours – ushering the era of ‘Do It Yourself 
cuisine’ in India. The look and feel of all outlets is rustic and casual with wood 
and open-brick wall surface. The sizzle of the grills livens up the whole atmosphere
and gives diners a comfortable and cosy experience.In its very first outlet in Mumbai
in 2006, Barbeque Nation inculcated the one principle that would cause the chain to 
expand pan-India in an amazingly short time period, putting the customer first at all 
steps of the dining experience – from reserving a table and customizing the level of 
spiciness,to creating in house live entertainment and taking feedback from customers 
long after their dining experience was over.
